abstract = {Dirac notation is widely used in quantum physics and quantum programming languages to define, compute and reason about quantum states. This paper considers Dirac notation from the perspective of automated reasoning. We prove two main results: first, the first-order theory of Dirac notation is decidable, by a reduction to the theory of real closed fields and Tarski's theorem. Then, we prove that validity of equations can be decided efficiently, using term-rewriting techniques. We implement our equivalence checking algorithm in Mathematica, and showcase its efficiency across more than 100 examples from the literature.},

abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

@article{Lewis2023,
   abstract = {Over the past 27 years, quantum computing has seen a huge rise in interest from both academia and industry. At the current rate, quantum computers are growing in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field. Significant efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum hardware and to develop suitable software to program quantum computers.In contrast, the verification of quantum programs has received relatively less attention. Verifying programs is especially important in the quantum setting due to how difficult it is to program complex algorithms correctly on resource-constrained and error-prone quantum hardware. Research into creating verification frameworks for quantum programs has seen recent development, with a variety of tools implemented using a collection of theoretical ideas.This survey aims to be a short introduction into the area of formal verification of quantum programs, bringing together theory and tools developed to date. Further, this survey examines some of the challenges that the field may face in the future, namely the development of complex quantum algorithms.},
