\section{Implementation and Case Study}
The improvement and extensions above concludes in our implementation called D-Hammer, a solver written in \CC. It has a parser built by ANTLR4, and scalar reasonings are powered by Mathematica Engine. The user can use commands to make definitions and assumptions in the maintained context, conduct the normalization and equivalence checking, and obtain the rewriting trace output. 
It can be used from the command line interactively, or can be integrated into other \CC\ projects as a library.
This implementation is tested on the benchmark of the previous work and new examples for labelled Dirac notation, demonstrating significant improvement in expressivity and efficiency. 
The tool and example encodings will be open-source and publicly available.

\subsubsection{Structure and Mechanism} 
The project consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{antlr4}: the third-party library for building the parser.
    \item \texttt{WSTP interface}: the wrapper to link with Mathematica Engine.
    \item \texttt{ualg}: the framework module for universal algebra, defining basic concepts like terms and substitutions.
    \item \texttt{dhammer}: the main module containing symbols definitions, type checking, rewriting rules, normalization algorithm and the prover.
    \item \texttt{example}: an example benchmark for evaluation.
    \item \texttt{toplevel}: the command line application.
\end{itemize}
% The project structure is illustrated in~\Cref{fig: dhammer structure}.
% \texttt{ualg} is the module for universal algebra, defining basic concepts like terms and substitutions. It serves as the library for \texttt{dhammer}, which are then utilized in the example benchmarks and the toplevel command line application. Important components of \texttt{dhammer} are:

% \input{fig/proj_structure.tex}

The internal data structure for terms is a pointer-based syntax tree following the function application style:
\[
    \texttt{
        term ::= ID | ID [term (, term)*].
    }
\]
The syntax tree can be an identifier, or an application with an identifier as the function head, and several syntax trees as arguments. There are several Dirac notation terms and their corresponding syntax trees.
\footnotesize{
\begin{align*}
    & X_1 + X_2 + X_3 && \texttt{ADD[X1, X2, X3]} 
    \\
    & \lambda x: \OType(T_1,  T_2). x^\dagger && \texttt{FUN[x, OTYPE[T1, T2], ADJ[x]]}
    \\
    & \sum_{i \in \mathbf{U}(T)} \ket{i} \bra{i} && \texttt{SUM[USET[T], FUN[i, BASIS[T], OUTER[KET[i], BRA[i]]]]}
\end{align*}
}
% The syntax tree structure is also compatible with the datatype of Mathematica. This improves the interoperability between D-Hammer and the Mathematica system, enabling them to work interleavingly.
To improve usability, D-Hammer also supports many special notations for terms,  and most Dirac notation terms will be encoded in the natural way.
Here are some examples for the parsing syntax.

\begin{figure}
    \center
\begin{tabular}{c >{\centering\arraybackslash}p{4cm} l}
    \hline
    syntax & parsing result & explanation \\
    \hline
    \texttt{|e>} & \texttt{KET[e]} & the ket basis\\
    \texttt{e1 + ... + en} & \texttt{ADD[e1, ..., en]} & the addition\\
    \texttt{e1\ e2} & \texttt{COMPO[e1, e2]} & composition in Dirac notation \\
    \texttt{e1\^{}*} & \texttt{CONJ[e1]} & scalar conjugation \\
    \texttt{fun i : T => X} & \texttt{FUN[i, T, X]} & lambda abstraction \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Finally, D-Hammer uses a prover to host the computation. The prover maintains a well-formed context $\Gamma$, and processes commands to modify the context and conduct calculations. The commands are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Def} ID := term.} It defines the \texttt{ID} as the \texttt{term}, using the \textbf{W-Def} typing rule.
    \item \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Var} ID := term.} It make an assumption of \texttt{ID} with the \texttt{term} as type, using the \textbf{W-Assume} typing rules.
    \item \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Check} term.} Type checking the \texttt{term} and output the result.
    \item \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Normalize} term.} Normalize the \texttt{term} using the algorithm introduced in~\Cref{sec: decide}.
    \item \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{CheckEq} term \textcolor{NavyBlue}{with} term.} Check the equivalence of the two terms calculating and comparing their normal forms.
\end{itemize}
The prover will type check the terms for each command. We can also use \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Normalize} term \textcolor{NavyBlue}{with trace}.} to output the proof trace during normalization. The proof trace is a sequence of records, including the rule or transformation appied, the position of application, and the pre- and post-transformation terms. The record helps understand the normalization procedure better, and can be turned into verified proofs in theorem provers in the future.


\subsubsection{Use Case}
As a tutorial, we encode the motivating~\Cref{ex: motivating}, examine and explain how to check it using D-Hammer. The encoding is shown below.

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=dhammer]
Var T : INDEX. Var M : OTYPE[T, T].
Def phi := idx T => Sum nv in USET[T], |(nv, nv)>.
Var r1 : REG[T]. Var r2 : REG[T].
CheckEq M_r1 (phi T)_(r1, r2) with (TPO T T M)_r2 (phi T)_(r1, r2).
    \end{lstlisting}        

The first three lines use the \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Var}} and \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{Def}} commands to set up the context for the Dirac notation.
\texttt{T} is a type index, representing arbitrary Hilbert space types. \texttt{M} is assumed to be an operator in the Hilbert space with type \texttt{T}. \texttt{phi} is defined as the maximally entangled state, depending on the bound variable \texttt{T} as index.
\texttt{r1} and \texttt{r2} are register names for the two subsystems.

In the left hand side of \texttt{\textcolor{NavyBlue}{CheckEq}} command, \texttt{M\_r1} denotes the labelled notation $M_{r_1}$, and \texttt{(phi T)\_(r1, r2)} denotes the entangled state $\ket{\Phi}_{(r_1, r_2)}$. They are connected by a white space, which is parsed into the composition of Dirac notation, and will be reduced into the operator-ket multiplication after typing. The right hand side is interpreted similarly, except the defined symbol \texttt{TPO} in the context:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=dhammer]
Def TPO := idx sigma => idx tau => fun O : OTYPE[sigma, tau] => Sum i in USET[sigma], Sum j in USET[tau], (<i| O |j>).(|j> <i|).
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{TPO} symbol represents the transpose of operators, and encodes the formalization in~\Cref{ex: formalizing motivating}. Other commonly used concepts in Dirac notation are encoded and provided as defined symbols in D-Hammer.

Within one second, the prover reports the result of equivalence with their common normal form:
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=dhammer]
The two terms are equal.
[Normalized Term] SUM[USET[T], FUN[BASIS[T], SUM[USET[T], FUN[BASIS[T], SCR[DOT[BRA[$\texttt{\$1}$], MULK[M, KET[$\texttt{\$0}$]]], LTSR[LKET[$\texttt{\$1}$, r1], LKET[$\texttt{\$0}$, r2]]]]]]] : DTYPE[RSET[r1, r2], RSET]
    \end{lstlisting}

The normal form is in the internal syntax tree format mentioned above. A more readable interpretation is:
\[
\sum_{\mathbf{U}(T)} \sum_{\mathbf{U}(T)} \bra{\$1}M\ket{\$ 0} . \ket{\$1}_{r_1} \otimes \ket{\$0}_{r_2} : \DType(\{r_1, r_2\}, \emptyset).
\]
Here $\$0$ and $\$1$ are de Bruijn indices. The result is a ket on the $\{r_1, r_2\}$ system as expected, and follows pattern proposed in~\Cref{sec: labelled}.



\section{Evaluation}
We evaluate D-Hammer on several example sets, and make a comparison with the previous tool DiracDec~\cite{diracdec}.
The experiments are carried out using a MacBook Pro with M3 Max chip. Results are summarized as follows.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}        
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Textbook (QCQI)}
The 18 examples of QCQI textbook equations from DiracDec are all encoded and solved. The running time are short and close because these examples are simple and direct.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{fig/coqq.pdf}
    \caption{Time comparison between DiracDec and D-Hammer on the CoqQ benchmark.}
    \label{fig: CoqQ plot}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CoqQ}
As to expressibility, D-Hammer encodes 158 examples for the CoqQ part, 4 less than DiracDec. This is because the language for DiracDec has the support for projectors $\texttt{fst}$ and $\texttt{snd}$ on basis pairs, satisfying $\texttt{fst} (s, t) = s$ and $\texttt{snd} (s, t) = t$. We found this feature is almost not used and removed the support. For decidability, we improved the rewriting rules about sum for D-Hammer, and proved several more examples failed by DiracDec. 
\Cref{fig: CoqQ plot} shows a direct comparison of their time efficiency.
We can observe that for small examples, D-Hammer is slower because of the marginal overhead. 
When the running time goes up, D-Hammer provides 2 to 40 times of acceleration in average.
The relationship between efficiency improvement and example characteristics further supports the necessity of our algorithm. 
We find that examples with great efficiency improvement, e.g. COQQ-129 and COQQ-148 shown in~\Cref{fig: CoqQ plot}, tend to use deeply nested summations, where our algorithm has an effect.

% \subsubsection{Others}
% Other examples are taken from quantum circuits and one recent paper [TODO]. Because these examples involve decomposition on concrete $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ qubit basis, resulting a lot of addition elements, our algorithm dealing with AC symbols brings along significant improvement.
% One typical example is
% \begin{gather*}
%     (I \otimes P) \cdot U \cdot (I \otimes P) \cdot U^\dagger = \ket{0}\bra{0} \otimes I + \ket{1}\bra{1}\otimes (P \cdot P), \\
%     \textrm{where } P \triangleq e^{-i\theta/2} \ket{0}\bra{0} + e^{i\theta/2}\ket{1}\bra{1}, \qquad U \triangleq \ket{0}\bra{0} \otimes X + \ket{1}\bra{1} \otimes I.
% \end{gather*}
% It takes DiracDec about one minute, but D-Hammer solves it within one second.


\subsubsection{Labelled Dirac Notation}
We present a new set of examples for labelled Dirac notation (LDN). These examples, illustrated in~\Cref{fig: labelled examples}, include six representative cases drawn from a variety of sources, such as well-established theorems, research paper results, quantum circuit equivalence, and quantum program verification.
D-Hammer normalizes them and successfully checks their equivalence using the algorithm in~\Cref{sec: labelled}.
Among the examples, LDN-12 shows the flexibility in combining labelled Dirac notations.
LDN-14 shows how to calculate controlled-not gate in different ways. 
%In LDN-18, $q, q_1$ and $q_2$ represent variables for quantum programs, and the equation shows the change of the state after applying $X$ gate on $q_2$. 
% Experiments show that our algorithm is relatively inefficient for labelled Dirac notations based on qubits.

It is a noteworthy result that D-Hammer solved LDN-10, a highly complex and lengthy example. It is a theorem on quantum separation logic from~\cite{DBLP:conf/lics/ZhouBHYY21}, and is challenging to prove even for experts. Notice that 7 registers are involved here, and it would be impractical to organize and referring to the subsystems without using labels.
