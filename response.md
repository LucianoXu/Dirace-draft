Following our proposal in the authors response and the shepherd's
message, the main changes in the revised version are as follows:

* Expanded related work with comparison with ZX calculus and other
  approaches

* Added discussion about egraphs in related work

* Clarified in evaluation that efficiency gains result from
  algorithmic improvements

* Expanded evaluation with comparison with ZX-calculus and other tools
  on small scale examples.

* Added clarification and short explanation before and after Theorem
  2, and longer proof sketch in Appendix D.2

* Added proof sketch of Theorem 1 in Appendix D.1

We are currently encoding about 30 additional examples of labelled
Dirac notation in D-Hammer. We plan to submit these examples in the
artefact evaluation and to update the final version of the paper (if
accepted) with these additional examples.
