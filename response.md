Main changes:

* Expanded related work with comparison with ZX calculus and other
  approaches

* Added discussion about egraphs in related work

* Clarified in evaluation that efficiency gains result from
  algorithmic improvements

* Expanded evaluation with comparison with ZX-calculus and other tools.

* Added clarification and short explanation before and after Theorem
  2, and longer proof sketch in Appendix D.2

* Added proof sketch of Theorem 1 in Appendix D.1

We also gathered around 30 additional examples of labelled Dirac notation and we are currently encoding them in the tool.
